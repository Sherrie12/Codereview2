You donâ€™t have some essential comments on your html files, which sometimes are not readable. You should write comments about why you write the code like this.
Your code is testable, which is pretty good. And I run unit test for your website, the result is pretty awesome. You 13 URLs are all accessible. I choose 20 different locations to access your website. The average time and speed are 0.52s and 6.20kb/s. The best time and speed are 0.15s and 16.94kb/s. The worst time and speed are 1.01s and 2.54kb/s. The accessing time is really fast and amazing. Good work!
Also, some functions in your website are still not usable, like casting and reviewing.
